# Tutorial 1 - Introduction
This tutorial aims to introduce the SPAARO framework. Topics will include the different components such as MATLAB/Simulink code, the C++ code. By the end of the tutorial, one is expected to be able to understand the data structure of Spaaro and how they interact between C++ and MATLAB, and able to open and load an empty flight control model on Simulink.
