# Tutorial 2 - Autocode generation
This tutorial will outline the step to setup a valid Simulink flight code and auto-generate the corresponding C++ code. Then, the flight control code is uploaded to the FMU-MINI and test with a simple demo

## Hardware components
FMU-MINI
SBUS receiver and transmitter
Mavlink telemetry module

## C++ Code components

### Flight code

### Log converter code

## MATLAB/Simulink

### MATLAB code and setup
